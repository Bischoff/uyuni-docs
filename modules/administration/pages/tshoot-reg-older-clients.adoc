= Troubleshooting Registering Older Clients

To register and use {centos}{nbsp}6, {oracle}{nbsp}6, {rhel}{nbsp}6, {sleses}{nbsp}6, or {sles}Â 11 clients, you need to configure the {productname} Server to support older types of SSL encryption.

If you are attempting to register at the command prompt, you see an error like this:

----
Repository '<Repository_Name>' is invalid.
[|] Valid metadata not found at specified URL(s)
Please check if the URIs defined for this repository are pointing to a valid repository.
Skipping repository '<Repository_Name>' because of the above error.
Download (curl) error for 'www.example.com':
Error code: Unrecognized error
Error message: error:1409442E:SSL routines:SSL3_READ_BYTES:tlsv1 alert protocol version
----

If you are attempting to register in the {webui}, you see an error like this:

----
Rendering SLS 'base:bootstrap' failed: Jinja error: >>> No TLS 1.2 and above for RHEL6 and SLES11. Please check your Apache config.
...
----

This occurs because Apache requires TLS{nbsp}v1.2, but older operating systems do not support this version of the TLS protocol.
To fix this error, you need to force Apache on the server to accept a greater range of protocol versions.
On the {productname} Server, as root, open the [path]``/etc/apache2/ssl-global.conf`` configuration file, locate the [systemitem]``SSLProtocol`` line, and update it to read:

----
SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 -SSLv3
----

This needs to be done manually on the server, and with a Salt state on the Proxy, if applicable.
Restart the [systemitem]``apache`` service on each system after making the changes.
