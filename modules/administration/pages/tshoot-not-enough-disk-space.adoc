= Troubleshooting Not Enough Disk Space

Check the available disk space before you begin migration.
We recommend locating [path]``/var/spacewalk`` and [path]``/var/lib/pgsql`` on separate XFS file systems.

When you are setting up a separate file system, edit [path]``/etc/fstab`` and remove the [path]``/var/lib/pqsql`` subvolume.
Reboot the server to pick up the changes.

To get more information about an upgrade problem, check the migration log file.
The log file is located at [path]``/var/log/rhn/migration.log`` on the system you are upgrading.
